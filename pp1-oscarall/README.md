# PP1: Lexical Analysis

Based on Lawrence Rauchwerger Texas A\&M Decaf project wich is based on Maggie Johnson and Julie Zelenski Stanford CS143 projects

## Goal:
In the first programming project, you will get your compiler 
off to a great start by implementing the lexical analysis phase. 
For the first task of the front-end, you will use $lex$ to create 
a scanner for the Decaf programming language.  A few transformations 
will be dealt with by a preprocessor, and then your scanner will 
run through the source program, recognizing Decaf tokens in the 
order in which they are read, until end-of-file is reached. For each 
token, your scanner will set its attributes appropriately (this will 
eventually be used by other components of your compiler) so that 
information about each token will be properly printed. 

Please refer to the file `pp1.pdf` for a thorough description of the project

## Submission
The project will be submitted through classroom.github.com

## Grading
This project is worth 50 points. Most of the points will be allocated 
for correctness. Your program will process the given test files 
from the samples directory as well as other tests of our own, using 
$diff -w$ to compare your output to that of our solution.
