Decaf Semantic Analysis

Based on Lawrence Rauchwerger Texas A&M Decaf project wich is based on Maggie Johnson and Julie Zelenski Stanford CS143 projects

## Goal
In the fourd programming project, your job is to finish the implementation of 
a semantic analyzer for your compiler. You're now at the last phase of the 
front-end.

Our semantic analyzer will traverse the parse tree constructed by the parser 
and validate that the semantic rules of the language are being respected, 
printing appropriate error messages for violations. This assignment has a 
bit more room for design decisions than the previous assignments. Your program 
will be considered correct if it verifies the semantic rules and reports 
appropriate errors, but there are various ways to go about accomplishing this 
and ultimately how you structure things is up to you. Your finished submission 
will have a working semantic analyzer that reports all varieties of errors. 

In pp4, we include quite a few more sample code, but it does not have their 
output counterparts.

Please refer to the file `pp3-4.pdf` in this repository for a thorough 
description of the project.

## Submission
Please submit your project by pushing to your repository at github classroom. I encourage you to push your changes frequently. Once your project is ready for me to review, please send me a message via Piazza. Any changes after your message will be considered but if they are after the delivery date/time, they will be penalized according to the rules of the course.

## Grading
The final pp4 submission is worth 100 points. We will `diff` your output against 
our solution as a first pass, expecting that we will likely have made similar 
choices for most situations, but we will also be examining your output manually. 
The chief criteria we will use is whether your output makes sense from the point 
of view of a programmer using your compiler.  If your output varies from the 
provided solution/dcc, please document your design decision in the next section of
README.md file.
