# PP1: Sintax Analysis

Based on Lawrence Rauchwerger Texas A\&M Decaf project wich is based on Maggie Johnson and Julie Zelenski Stanford CS143 projects

## Goal:
In this programming project, you will extend your Decaf compiler to 
handle the syntax analysis phase, the second task of the front-end, 
by using `bison` to create a parser.  The parser will read Decaf 
source programs and construct a parse tree. If no syntax errors were 
found, your compiler will print the completed parse tree at the end 
of parsing. At this stage, you aren't responsible for verifying 
semantic rules, just the syntactic structure. The purpose of this 
project is to familiarize you with the tools and give you experience 
in solving typical difficulties that arise when using them to generate 
a parser.

Please refer to the file `pp1.pdf` for a thorough description of the project

## Submission
The project will be submitted through classroom.github.com

## Grading
This project is worth 70 points that will be allocated for
correctness. We will run your program through the given test files 
from the samples directory as well as other tests of our own, using 
`diff -w` to compare your output to that of our solution.
